                <p>The Solar System[c] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[4] 
                    The largest of these objects are the eight planets, which in order from the Sun are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); 
                    two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). 
                    The Solar System developed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc.</p>

                <h3 style="color: white; padding: 30px;">Evolution</h3>
                <p>The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.[e] 
                This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.[6] As is typical of molecular clouds,
                 this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars.[7]
                 As the pre-solar nebula[7] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The center, where most of the mass collected, 
                 became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.[6] As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary 
                 disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU (30 billion km; 19 billion mi)[6] and a hot, dense protostar at the center.[8][9] The planets formed by 
                 accretion from this disc,[10] in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets
                  may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.[11][12]

                <p> Sun is the dominant gravitational member of the Solar System, and its planetary system is maintained in a relatively stable, slowly evolving state by following isolated,
                 gravitationally bound orbits around the Sun.[20] Although the Solar System has been fairly stable for billions of years, it is technically chaotic, and may eventually be disrupted 
                 (see Stability of the Solar System). There is also a small chance that another star will pass through the Solar System in the next billion years. Although this could destabilize the system
                  and eventually lead millions of years later to expulsion of planets, collisions of planets, or planets hitting the Sun, it would most likely leave the Solar System much as it is today.[21]
        
                The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four smaller inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded
                 by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.
                  The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets.[22] Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting 
                  of the objects beyond Neptune.[23]</p>

                <h3 style="color: white; padding: 30px;">Inner Solar System</h3>
                <p>The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.[83] Composed mainly of silicates and metals,[84] the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. 
                This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (750 million km; 
                460 million mi) from the Sun.[24]</p>

                <h3 style="color: white; padding: 30px;">Outer Solar System</h3><br>
                <p>The four outer planets, also called giant planets or Jovian planets, collectively make up 99% of the mass known to orbit the Sun.[g] 
                Jupiter and Saturn are together more than 400 times the mass of Earth and consist overwhelmingly of the gases hydrogen and helium, hence 
                their designation as gas giants.[130] Uranus and Neptune are far less massive—less than 20 Earth masses (MEarth) each—and are composed primarily of ice. 
                For these reasons, some astronomers suggest they belong in their own category, ice giants.[131] All four giant planets have rings, although only Saturn's 
                ring system is easily observed from Earth. The term superior planet designates planets outside Earth's 
                orbit and thus includes both the outer planets and Mars.[85]
